# Apache-Spark-Churn-Application
Big Data is a concept that enables businesses and organizations to process large and complex datasets, extracting valuable insights. The rapidly increasing volume and diversity of this big data provide a competitive advantage to businesses, allowing them to make better-informed decisions. Big Data plays a crucial role in extracting meaning from data and providing strategic guidance, particularly when combined with analytical and artificial intelligence technologies.


In this study, I developed a customer churn prediction model using the GBM algorithm on Apache Spark APIs in Python. The dataset includes customer features, and after data cleaning and feature engineering, the model was trained using the GBTClassifier algorithm. Various metrics and cross-validation were employed to measure the performance of the model. As a result, a successful model was obtained to predict the probabilities of new customers churning or not.
